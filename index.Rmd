Hi there!

**It is now `r Sys.Date()`** as I compile this page. This is a small assignment done for the Coursera Data Science specialization. While you're looking at this, here's a bunch of my favorite restaurants. If you ever happen to visit Helsinki, be sure to check these out!
```{r, include = FALSE}
restaurants <- data.frame(
  lat = c(60.158196, 60.170298, 60.171141, 60.186011, 60.169332, 60.177713),
  lng = c(24.934568, 24.958396, 24.932730, 24.953489, 24.949061, 24.928050),
  name = c("BasBas", "Kuurna", "AteljÃ© Finne", "Wino", "Copas y Tapas", "Kuu")
)
```


```{r}
leaflet() %>%
  setView(lat = 60.1659, lng = 24.9394, zoom = 12) %>%
  addTiles %>%
  addMarkers(lat = restaurants$lat, lng = restaurants$lng, label = restaurants$name)
```
