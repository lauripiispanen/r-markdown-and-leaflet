# Plotting the mtcars dataset

### Hi there!

**It is now `r Sys.Date()`** as I compile this page. This is a small assignment done for the Coursera Data Science specialization. Please enjoy some visualizations of some real cool retro cars!

```{r include = FALSE}
library(plotly)

mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
levels(mtcars$cyl) <- c("4 cyl", "6 cyl", "8 cyl")
```

# Fuel economy by number of cylinders

```{r}
plot_ly(y = mtcars$mpg, color = mtcars$cyl, type = "box")
```

# 1/4 mile times by horsepower

```{r}
fit <- lm(hp ~ qsec, mtcars)
mtcars %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~qsec) %>%
  add_markers(y = ~hp, color = ~cyl) %>%
  add_lines(x = ~qsec, y = fitted(fit), showlegend = FALSE)
```
